            <h3>Journey</h3>
            <p>
                Thanks to my uncle, I was introduced to the world of computers at a young age. With a pentium-powered computer and a 2GB of RAM, I managed to play games and explore the world of the internet. I was amazed by the things I can do with a computer. The things I did? Play games, tinker around the operating system, 'hack' things, socialized online, and more! I was inspired to become a software engineer!

            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>
                I'm interested in a lot of things. But the things I'm interested the most are playing video games, watching movies, programming, and listening to classical music. I also read books sometimes, and right now, I'm reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10155.The_Lost_World">The Lost World</a> by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

                I grew up playing dinosaur and prehistoric games most of the time, my favorite TV show that I always play on TV and VHS/DVD was Barney -- a dinosaur! I watched and loved King Kong (2005), I played a little game named <a href="https://twitter.com/neosaurs?lang=en">Neosaurs</a>. Heck, I loved watching dinosaur documentaries when I was a kid. Oh, ever heard of Land Before Time? I loved that movie!

        <h3>Quotes</h3>
        <p>
            I loved Steve Jobs. He inspires me to do great things. Here's a quote from him:
        </p>
    
        <div class="quote-txt-img">
            <div class="nes-balloon from-right">
            "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle."
